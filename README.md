# FUSION FIGHTERS MARTIAL ARTS CLUB WEBSITE

The website can be viewed [here](https://davep33l.github.io/fusion_fighters/).

## High Level Site Owner Goals

Fusion Fighters Martial Arts is a multi-discipline martial arts club based in the UK. It is focused on providing training in 3 major disciplines. The 3 disciplines are Judo, which is primarily a throw-based martial art, Karate, which is primarily a striking-based martial art and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ), which is primarily a ground-based martial art. 

The owner and chief instructor of the club currently only promotes his club via leaflets and does not have a presence online. The owner wants to have a presence online where he can direct future members in order to provide them with information on the club and to increase membership to the club by giving visitors the ability to request more information and/or sign up.

## Strategy

**Business Goals**: To drive new members to join the club by providing a place to showcase information on the club and to contact the club.

**Uniqueness**: Fusion Fighters Martial Arts is unique as it provides a mix of martial art disciplines that a member of the club will be trained in. Allowing the member to become a more rounded fighter vs training in one style only. 

**User Value**: As the popularity of The UFC and Mixed Martial Arts increases, it would be expected that people who are wishing to train in martial arts want variety. Fusion Fighters Martial Arts provides this variety with the 3 different styles on offer. Those being Judo, Karate and Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. It provides 3 key aspects to becoming a rounded fighter, a throw based martial art (Judo), a striking based martial art (Karate) and a ground based martial art (Brazilian Jiu Jitsu). 

**Research**: Google Trends for UFC (the primary mixed martial arts franchise in the world) searches from 2004 to Oct 2023 shows increase in popularity. Highlighting the interest in mixed martial arts disciplines.

## Structure

### Structural Decisions

- 1 page linear navigational site for ease of use
- Will contain a hamburger menu for mobile and an expanded menu for laptop and larger
- Navigation links will navigate to different sections on the same page
- Page flow is like a what, why, who, why, when - which leads the user through a journey of information, with a sign up/contact at the bottom. 
- Start with Mobile design first in a basic column based view, and improve the layout when expanding screen size
- Ensure that there is content hinting, which shows the next section at the bottom of the screen

## Surface

### Typography

As most martial arts have a heritage dating back to Eastern Asia, I wanted to reflect this within the typography. The fonts chosen maintain a degree of flourishes to link back to East Asian written languages, but also contain striking straight lines to symbolise martial arts in the modern era, making both fonts both classic, modern and elegant whilst still being easy to read.  

Fonts for the site were obtained from google-fonts. The fonts chosen were:

1. [Cinzel](https://fonts.google.com/?query=cinzel) - which falls back to a basic serif font if import fails

![Cinzel font example](/readme/cinzel.png)

2. [Philosopher](https://fonts.google.com/?query=philosopher)

![Philosopher font example](/readme/philosopher.png)

### Colours

I took inspiration for my colours from what Martial Artist wear. That being the Gi and the Black Belt. I used the coolers website to visualize these all together.

I chose a strong dark colour to symbolize a Black Belt, which is generally the highest level belt a martial arts practitioner can attain. This is not entirly black, as throughout the time as a practitioner, the belt fades giving a slightly blue tinge. 

I chose a grey, to be an accent tone to this, and use where I did not require such a dark colour. 

I chose the yellow/gold as it symbolizes winning (gold medals) and is also the most common colour used for martial art belt embroidery.

I chose a striking scarlet red as it is also a common colour used on martial art belt embroidery and uniform emblems. 

I chose a very slightly off white as my light colour as this is the main colour for a martial arts gi.

## Features

- The site is fully responsive on a range of devices and screeens ([see testing for evidence](#testing))

- The site has an interactive form which allows for completion and submission and redirection to a success/Thank you page

- The site has a responsive navigation bar for the home page that links to each section of the page. Which also is present on the 404 and success/Thank you page, and redirects back to the home page

## Future Features

I would like to implement a navigation using javascript.

I would like to have a members area with training tips/plans and workout videos

### User Stories Testing (General Commentary)

The landing page has a striking image of a martial arts practitioner centered in the screen with a clear heading and description of the nature of the site (Training for Martial Arts).

The Flow of information is intuitive with clear headings that describe each section. There is an alternating colour for each heading and background to maintain interest to the user. 

The colour and images used are nice and consistent and easily readable.

The styles sections has a nice title for each style with some gold decoration symbolising the "Dan" grades you can achieve when you are a martial artist. 

The instructor section has 3 strong images with nice complementary colours. 

The background image on the about section is a nice and subtle break from the solid colour backgrounds, and the transparancy is a nice touch of elegance. 

The site is nicely broken up into cards and text sections to keep interest and doesn't seem overbearing with too much information. 

It was has reviews from other members as this is a key aspect when "purchasing" something in general. 

The contact form is simple and doesn't ask for too much information, and it directs to a nice thank you page once completed and give the options to go back to relevant sections of the main page via the navigation bar, or via the return home link. 

There is a working 404 page if an incorrect link is part of the page, which also redirects back to the home page via a link. Whilst showing a nice message to the user.

The idea for coolers was from the readme webinar by Kera Cudmore (Thank you if you read this).

I want to thank my mentor for his support throughout this project and for specifically directing me to the BEM methodology.
