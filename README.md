# FUSION FIGHTERS MARTIAL ARTS CLUB

The website can be viewed here [Fusion Fighers](https://davep33l.github.io/fusion_fighters/)

## High Level Site Owner Goals

Fusion Fighters Martial Arts is a multi-discipline martial arts club based in the UK. It is focused on providing training in 3 major disciplines. The 3 disciplines are Judo, which is primarily a throw-based martial art, Karate, which is primarily a striking-based martial art and Brazilian Jiu Jitsu (BJJ), which is primarily a ground-based martial art. 

The owner and chief instructor of the club currently only promotes his club via leaflets and does not have a presence online. The owner wants to have a presence online where he can direct future members in order to provide them with information on the club and to increase membership to the club by giving visitors the ability to request more information and/or sign up. 

## Strategy

**Business Goals**: To drive new members to join the club by providing a place to showcase information on the club and to contact the club.

**Uniqueness**: Fusion Fighters Martial Arts is unique as it provides a mix of martial art disciplines that a member of the club will be trained in. Allowing the member to become a more rounded fighter vs training in one style only. 

**User Value**: As the popularity of The UFC and Mixed Martial Arts increases, it would be expected that people who are wishing to train in martial arts want variety. Fusion Fighters Martial Arts provides this variety with the 3 different styles on offer. Those being Judo, Karate and Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. It provides 3 key aspects to becoming a rounded fighter, a throw based martial art (Judo), a striking based martial art (Karate) and a ground based martial art (Brazilian Jiu Jitsu). 

**Research**: Google Trends for MMA searches from 2004 to Oct 2023 shows increase in popularity. Highlighting the mixed interest in martial arts disciplines.

## Structure

### Structural Decisions

- 1 page linear navigational site for ease of use
- Will contain a hamburger menu for mobile and an expanded menu for laptop and larger
- Navigation links will navigate to different sections on the same page
- Page flow is like a what, why, who, why, when - which leads the user through a journey of information, with a sign up/contact at the bottom. 
- Start with Mobile design first in a basic column based view, and improve the layout when expanding screen size
- Ensure that there is content hinting, which shows the next section at the bottom of the screen
