# FUSION FIGHTERS MARTIAL ARTS CLUB WEBSITE

The website can be viewed [here](https://davep33l.github.io/fusion_fighters/).

## High Level Site Owner Goals

Fusion Fighters Martial Arts is a multi-discipline martial arts club based in the UK. It is focused on providing training in 3 major disciplines. The 3 disciplines are Judo, which is primarily a throw-based martial art, Karate, which is primarily a striking-based martial art and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ), which is primarily a ground-based martial art. 

The owner and chief instructor of the club currently only promotes his club via leaflets and does not have a presence online. The owner wants to have a presence online where he can direct future members in order to provide them with information on the club and to increase membership to the club by giving visitors the ability to request more information and/or sign up.

## Strategy

**Business Goals**: To drive new members to join the club by providing a place to showcase information on the club and to contact the club.

**Uniqueness**: Fusion Fighters Martial Arts is unique as it provides a mix of martial art disciplines that a member of the club will be trained in. Allowing the member to become a more rounded fighter vs training in one style only. 

**User Value**: As the popularity of The UFC and Mixed Martial Arts increases, it would be expected that people who are wishing to train in martial arts want variety. Fusion Fighters Martial Arts provides this variety with the 3 different styles on offer. Those being Judo, Karate and Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. It provides 3 key aspects to becoming a rounded fighter, a throw based martial art (Judo), a striking based martial art (Karate) and a ground based martial art (Brazilian Jiu Jitsu). 

**Research**: Google Trends for UFC (the primary mixed martial arts franchise in the world) searches from 2004 to Oct 2023 shows increase in popularity. Highlighting the interest in mixed martial arts disciplines.

## Structure

### Structural Decisions

- 1 page linear navigational site for ease of use
- Will contain a hamburger menu for mobile and an expanded menu for laptop and larger
- Navigation links will navigate to different sections on the same page
- Page flow is like a what, why, who, why, when - which leads the user through a journey of information, with a sign up/contact at the bottom. 
- Start with Mobile design first in a basic column based view, and improve the layout when expanding screen size
- Ensure that there is content hinting, which shows the next section at the bottom of the screen

## Surface

### Typography

As most martial arts have a heritage dating back to Eastern Asia, I wanted to reflect this within the typography. The fonts chosen maintain a degree of flourishes to link back to East Asian written languages, but also contain striking straight lines to symbolise martial arts in the modern era, making both fonts both classic, modern and elegant. 

Fonts for the site were obtained from google-fonts. The fonts chosen were:

1. [Cinzel](https://fonts.google.com/?query=cinzel)

![Cinzel font example](/readme/cinzel.png)

2. [Philosopher](https://fonts.google.com/?query=philosopher)

![Philosopher font example](/readme/philosopher.png)

### Colours

I took inspiration for my colours from what Martial Artist wear. That being the Gi and the Black Belt. I used the coolers website to visualize these all together.

I chose a strong dark colour to symbolize a Black Belt, which is generally the highest level belt a martial arts practitioner can attain. This is not entirly black, as throughout the time as a practitioner, the belt fades giving a slightly blue tinge. 

I chose a grey, to be an accent tone to this, and use where I did not require such a dark colour. 

I chose the yellow/gold as it symbolizes winning (gold medals) and is also the most common colour used for martial art belt embroidery.

I chose a striking scarlet red as it is also a common colour used on martial art belt embroidery and uniform emblems. 

I chose a very slightly off white as my light colour as this is the main colour for a martial arts gi.

Chrome Dev Tools was used throughout the development of the website, utilizing the Lighthouse functionality to highlight any performance  accessibility improvements that could be made. 

Chrome Dev Tools specifically helped with the concurrence of my image sizes and adding heights and widths to images to prevent content layout shift.

HTML was tested using the [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)

CSS was tested using Jigsaw, the [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

## Acknowledgements / Credits

The idea for coolers was from the readme webinar from Kera Cudmore (Thank you if you read this)

I referenced [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) throughout this project.

Feedback from mid-project mentor session highlighted inconsistency of the space to the left and right of each of the sections. On this feedback I adjusted the padding of each container from 2rem to 1rem and removed some styles that were overriding the 100% width (which I had previously set to 80% width).
