# FUSION FIGHTERS MARTIAL ARTS CLUB

## High Level Site Owner Goals

Fusion Fighters Martial Arts is a multi-discipline martial arts club based in the UK. It is focused on providing training in 3 major disciplines. The 3 disciplines are Judo, which is primarily a throw-based martial art, Karate, which is primarily a striking-based martial art and Brazilian Jiu Jitsu (BJJ), which is primarily a ground-based martial art. 

The owner and chief instructor of the club currently only promotes his club via leaflets and does not have a presence online. The owner wants to have a presence online where he can direct future members in order to provide them with information on the club and to increase membership to the club by giving visitors the ability to request more information and/or sign up.
